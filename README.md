# Spark, a UX Library for Sketch
Spark is a Sketch library built by UX designers, for UX designers. It contains a variety of components, elements, text styles and tools to help you design faster and consistently. Save time by chucking this library into your project and get going!

## How to Get Started
### 1. Download Roboto
Spark uses the free font family Roboto from Google across all of its components. To ensure full compatiblity, download the family and install it.

### 2. Get Familiar
The kit is comprised of multiple pages, organized by either platform or type of component. You can see the categorization spelled out below.

### 3. Start Designing
That’s all you need. The goal is this kit gives you more time to design than looking of all of the individual resources you’d need. We hope you love it as much as we do!
