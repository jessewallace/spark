# Spark, a UX Library for Sketch
Spark is a Sketch library built by UX designers, for UX designers. It contains a variety of components, elements, text styles and tools to help you design faster and consistently. Save time by chucking this library into your project and get going!

## How to Get Started
### 1. Download Roboto
Spark uses the free font family Roboto from Google across all of its components. To ensure full compatiblity, download the family and install it.

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto

### 2. Get Familiar
The kit is comprised of multiple pages, organized by either platform or type of component. You can see the categorization spelled out below.

### 3. Start Designing
That’s all you need. The goal is this kit gives you more time to design than looking of all of the individual resources you’d need. We hope you love it as much as we do!

## What's Included?
There is a lot of stuff in Spark - here’s how we’ve organized everything:

**Android** 

UI for Android apps based on Material design

**Basic Components**

Contains a variety of cross-platform and device-agnostic components

**Charts**

Commonly used charts for quick insert

**Flows**

Responsive symbols to create user flows and documentation

**Form Fields**

Commonly used form field items. States and icons within fields are manipulatable.

**Icons**

A subset of Font Awesome 5.0 icons in vector format, listed alphabetically

**iOS**

UI for Apple Devices based on iOS 11/12 SDK

**Templates**

Prepackaged form templates for common cases, like login and address collection

**Typography**

Preset font styles in white, gray and black, as well as all three alignments

## How to Contribute
There are two ways to contribute: feature requests and pull requests.

# Feature Requests
Simply create an issue and tag it with *enhancements*.
To keep things simple, use this format:

```
Platform: [Web][iOS][Android][Other]
Name: NameOfThingy
Artifacts:  
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3
```

# Pull Requests
You can fork the file and add/make changes to things and set up a pull request. We will review and integrate changes when possible. A few rules:
- Don't change the name of things - this will actually break off old symbols, and that's a bugger.
- Make sure additions scale well and use the native Roboto font for any text.
- Be detailed in what you have done so we can quickly respond to the request.
